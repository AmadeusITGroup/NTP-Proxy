Leap Second Test tool consists of two programs which can be used 
for OS/application leap second immunity verification. 
*Set Leap Second - local leap second simulation - only for Linux
*NTP Proxy       - indirect leap second simulation via NTP 
                   ntpproxy has to run on Linux yet it can be used 
                   to test other OS-es if they utilize NTP
